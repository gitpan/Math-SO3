This package provides a simple (direct), fast (in C) implementation of
three-dimensional rotations, more widely known as "the SO(3) group".

It looks a bit object-oriented, but in fact isn't; just as it does not
make much sense to inherit from complex numbers, say, there is no
point in inheriting from rotations. In a way, rotations are just
"numbers". This package uses object-oriented syntax, though. Mainly to
prevent namespace pollution.

Furthermore, it can not immediately cooperate with PDL; the overhead
to support PDL would be so big it would kill a LOT of
performance. (Hey, look -- one may interpret complex numbers as real
2x2 matrices, and the Complex package also doesn't support
PDL. Remember: rotations are just some strange kind of "numbers".)

A word of warning: though I have tried hard to get everything right, I
still can not exclude with 100% confidence that this code contains
bugs, since I didn't prove its correctness. Especially the euler_angle
stuff probably will, in some rare cases (relative probability >1e-8 or
so), produce somewhat incorrect results. As always, no warranty.

However, I tried to make the code as readable as possible, which sadly
is not usual with numerical code in our decade.

For more info, see the Math::SO3 manpage.
